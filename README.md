**EEE3088F 2025 POWER MODULE PCB PROJECT- GITHUB REPO**
(PROJECT PARTNERS: Tanatswa Mukuyu, Sharaav Dhebideen)

_This repository contains the KiCad schematic and PCB files, in addition to the budget planning for designing a Micromouse's Power Module PCB. Please refer below on how to navigate and download files from this repository_

* REPOSITORY NAVIGATION:

1. Each project member worked their own schematic for their tasks. These schematics are found within _EEE3088F_PCB_Project_tanatswa_ and _EEE3088F_PCB_Project_sharaav_ .
2. After completing tasks, the separate schematics were combined into one and placed under the folder _EEE3088F_PCB_Project_combined_ .
3. The **combined schematic to which additional revisions were made**, is found within _EEE3088F_2025_PCB_PROJECT_original_version.zip_ .
4. The **combined schematic to which the submitted gerber files belongs to**, is found within _EEE3088F_2025_PCB_PROJECT_submitted_version.zip_ .
5. The above discrepancy is due to the exclusion of the USB interfacing circuitry and the Battery charging circuitry which caused errors when running the Electrical Rules Checker on KiCad. These parts of our board were excluded as it was urgent to get started with the PCB layout design.
6. The MS Excel file named _PCB project budget planning_ contains the calculations associated with component costs.

* REPOSITORY FILES/FOLDERS DOWNLOAD:

1. All schematic and PCB files were created using KiCad 9.0 therefore it is recommended to use KiCad 9.0 or above to open these files.
2. Download the compressed/zipped versions of _EEE3088F_2025_PCB_PROJECT_original_version_ and _EEE3088F_2025_PCB_PROJECT_submitted_version_ if wanting to access the final renditions of the Power Module's design.
